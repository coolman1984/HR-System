"""INT-01 acceptance tests: separate files uploaded together (attendance, employee,
roster, leave). Uses only synthetic data built in this file. Proves four cases:
a missing source, an unknown employee id, a late correction, and that upload
history is never wiped.

Roster and leave are read and validated independently but are not linked to
attendance rows yet; only the employee source is joined (employee_id is a
simple 1:1 key). Linking roster/leave by employee + work date is a separate,
not-yet-started stage (see project_memory/INT-01-SOURCE-CONTRACTS_AR.md).
