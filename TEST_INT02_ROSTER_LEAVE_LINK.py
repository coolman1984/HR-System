"""INT-02 acceptance tests: link roster and leave to attendance rows.

Roster is linked by a composite key (employee_id + work_date): each
attendance row's roster_shift_id/roster_status are filled only when a
matching roster row exists for that same employee and date.

Leave is linked by date-range matching (is work_date within an approved,
non-cancelled leave request's [start_date, end_date] for the same
employee), not a direct key join, because one employee can have several
leave requests. This must never duplicate attendance rows.

Uses only synthetic data built in this file.
